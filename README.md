## Welcome to FoodDice

FoodDice is an app for those who might be overwhelmed with choices of recipes, or those who simply don't know what to make for dinner.
Simply roll a dice, and let a suggested recipe roll inn!
There are also filtering-options for vegan or gluten-free recipes.

This was a school project to learn web-development from idea to end product.
Our end product has some fun/unfinished quirks, but feel free to test it out.
